 ## Technology:
 > Links ( click on titles )

 **1. [Node.js ](https://nodejs.org/en/):**

* Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. 

* A Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. 

* Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking.

**2. [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/):**

* Web Applications : Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

* APIs : With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware, creating a robust API is quick and easy.

* Performance : Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features.

**2.[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)**

* MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information

**3.[Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)**

* Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

**4. [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/products/insomnia):**

* Insomnia is a free cross-platform desktop application that takes the pain out of interacting with and designing HTTP-based APIs. Insomnia combines an easy-to-use interface with advanced functionality like authentication helpers, code generation, and environment variables.

 ## Usage:

 * Clone GitHub repository
 * Run `npm init` in your terminal
 * Ensure that MongoDB and Express are installed on your computer
 * Invoke application using `npm start`
